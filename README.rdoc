= RailsFancies

Rails Fancies is an open source project to develop some Ruby on Rails helpers.  Most rails helpers tend to be tightly focused on placing a single element on a page, like a link or an image tag.  Rails Fancies is for helpers that a more complex and can form the core of a web page. 
 
Early examples are helpers to produce an FAQ page and a Monthly Calendar.  Helpers in Rails Fancies do not have to be strictly practical, they can be fanciful in their purpose or in their design (though they do need to work).
